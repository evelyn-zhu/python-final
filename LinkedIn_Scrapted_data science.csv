In joining us as a Front End Web Developer Intern, you will gain invaluable experience working on the Smart Building IoT dashboard that automatically provides recommendations on how to optimize building operations to maximize energy savings while keeping a building safe and comfortable.


38% of global carbon emissions come from buildings, and 97% of US buildings specifically consistently bleed unused energy.

We analyze waste from lighting and HVAC, and provide solutions to eliminate it. With the simplicity of our tools, your focus can be on impact rather than installation.

InstaHub invites and enables environmentally-minded individuals, regardless of their age, income, or technical knowledge, to make simple but substantial changes in the buildings they utilize every day to reduce energy waste (and bills!).

We have deployed and will continue to deploy sensors into multiple buildings collecting 5 sensor data points per room about it’s conditions (e.g. space utilization, temperature, humidity, pressure, light, etc.) over time. Each building has multiple floors, rooms, room type, and users. Our objective is to provide an easy to read visualization of the data (Phase 1), automate pattern detection and segmentation (Phase 2), and automate the prioritization of recommendation of alerts (Phase 3) to ultimately help building managers make evidenced-based decisions for energy saving projects to tackle climate change as buildings contribute to 40% of global carbon emissions.

You will also have one weekly intern bonding session Tuesdays at 3pm EST and one weekly company-wide meeting on Fridays at 3pm EST. You will also be invited to attend regular game nights and speaker evenings.

Zipline is on a mission to transform the way goods move. Our aim is to solve the world’s most urgent and complex access challenges by building the first instant logistics system that serves all humans equally. Leveraging expertise in robotics and autonomy, Zipline designs, builds, and operates a fleet of cutting edge, autonomous delivery drones. We serve tens of millions of people around the world.

Joining Zipline’s Emerging Talent program as an intern is an opportunity to contribute to our promise of building a system that provides equitable access to critical healthcare supplies for millions of people. We believe that internships are more than just opportunities to learn by watching or doing low level tasks. We expect our interns to take on meaningful work that actively contributes to moving Zipline’s mission forward, while learning real-world skills that will serve them in their careers for the long term.

Join us, and build the future of logistics with the best humans around!



The Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) team is responsible for exploring and analyzing the impact of Zipline across countries and markets. We design impact evaluations where we assess how Zipline is transforming supply chains for vaccines, medical products, and other commodities. From that point, we move to population health and analyze to what extent improved supply chains can increase access to healthcare (the core of Zipline’s mission) and reduce the burden of disease. A large part of the work is designing and conducting health research. The other part is creating monitoring and evaluation frameworks for ongoing and prospective initiatives. The team is particularly interested in leveraging data science and modeling techniques to solve real-world environmental challenges.

This includes drafting research protocols, submissions to Ethics Review Committees, the design of surveys and other data collection tools, statistical analysis, report writing, and the presentation of findings. An ideal candidate will have a strong background in data science with a specific focus on subject matters related to environmental and/or transportation impact research. As an Environmental Impact Data Analyst Intern, your role will focus on assessing and reducing the environmental impact of our UAV logistics operations. You'll be working on immediate tasks such as completing Scope 1 and 2 emissions inventories, as well as forward-looking projects like simulating other environmental and health outcomes. It would be a great opportunity to learn more about any or all of these activities, and see firsthand how sustainable aerial logistics can transform people's health, lives, and ability to live sustainably.











The starting cash range for this role is $34.00 - 38.00 / hour. Please note that this is a target, starting cash range for a candidate who meets the minimum qualifications for this role. The final cash pay for this role will depend on a variety of factors, including a specific candidate's experience, qualifications, skills, and working location. The total compensation package for this role may also include: equity compensation; overtime pay; discretionary annual or performance bonuses; sales incentives; benefits such as medical, dental and vision insurance; paid time off; and more.

528,Quantile - An LSEG Business,Application Developer Internship,"New York, NY",3 weeks ago,"Quantile offers market-leading optimisation services that reduce counterparty risk, notional and capital requirements to increase the efficiency and liquidity of derivatives markets, improve returns for clients, and make the financial system safer.

We are part of LSEG's Post Trade division, where we connect a network of participants and use advanced algorithms to reduce risk and release capital. Since launch, our services have eliminated trillions of dollars of gross notional through interest rate compression and billions of dollars in initial margin and capital requirements through counterparty risk optimisation.

Our clients, including all the top tier global banks, regional banks, buy-side firms and other large institutional market participants, are serviced from offices in London, New York and Amsterdam – with Tokyo coming soon.

As a graduate in the engineering team, you'll have the opportunity to collaborate on cutting-edge solutions and make an impact on meaningful projects, including designing and enhancing our services and analysing the results.

Our services can be expressed mathematically as solutions to constrained convex optimisation problems. You'll work on converting real world financial data to solve such problems, ultimately delivering clients a set of actionable trades which can be used to optimise their portfolios. Our technology stack is predominantly JavaScript and Python and runs on the public cloud.

The application development team creates the systems that deliver the service to Quantile's clients. It is this team's responsibility to design and build systems that permit financial market participants to securely provide risk and trade data to Quantile, to deliver that data into the quantitate algorithms developed by the quants, and to return the output of those libraries safely back to the participants in a timely manner. In addition, the systems should provide feedback to the clients to help them to understand the results as well as how they can modify their parameters and data to gain improvements in the future. The Quantile systems live in the cloud, currently hosted by AWS.

The successful candidate will work as part of a small team of 5-7 developers to build and research improvements to the applications & environment. They will work directly with product management team to enhance the product based on feedback from clients and analysis of runs as well as on strategic projects. Examples of possible projects, all of which will involve writing a program in python, include

Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.

As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises from New York City’s yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.

Our Agency’s five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:


Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racism’s impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.


The College aide will collect data from salmonellosis cases and other foodborne illness cases. In 2009, NYC was awarded the Foodborne Diseases Centers for Outbreak Response Enhancement (FoodCORE) grant, as part of the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (ELC) grant, to be used specifically on improving foodborne outbreak detection and response.


Successful candidates will assist foodborne disease epidemiologists with the following activities:

Surveillance for foodborne diseases such as Salmonella, shigella, Campylobacter, and Shiga toxin producing E.coli infections.

Collection of case data from health care providers and interviewing case-patients about their illness and exposures

Outbreak investigations Data entry, data management, data analysis, and/or miscellaneous projects

Assist with other disease investigations within the Bureau of Communicable Disease where necessary.

At City Parks Foundation (CPF), we are dedicated to invigorating and transforming New York City parks into dynamic, vibrant centers of urban life through arts, environmental education, sports, and community building programs for all New Yorkers. Our ethos is simple: we believe thriving parks mean thriving communities.

Community engagement includes Partnerships for Parks, a public-private program of City Parks Foundation and NYC Parks, which supports and champions a growing network of community leaders who care and advocate for the transformation of our neighborhood parks and the Parks and Open Space Partners-NYC coalition of conservancies and alliances. We also administer the NYC Green Fund, a regranting program for parks and open space nonprofits and grassroots organizations.

We produce SummerStage, the iconic free, outdoor performing arts festival in NYC, presenting world-class artists from across the globe and our own neighborhoods on our mainstage in Central Park and in local parks in all five boroughs, and our Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre and roving PuppetMobile present marionette puppet theater throughout New York City.

We connect youngsters to nature in the urban environment through progressive, experiential teaching. Using parks as classrooms, we provide learning experiences and hands-on activities in urban forests, coastal areas, and gardens.

Free golf, tennis, track & field, soccer, and fitness programs bring high-quality instruction and equipment into areas where few organized athletic opportunities exist. We offer leveled training, year-round scholarship coaching, and special pro events.
